# Book-Item-Based-Collaborative-Filtering

Collaborative filtering methods are used to determine a user's level of interest in any product and to make recommendations by filtering products accordingly.

Product-based filtering, on the other hand, is a method that detects product similarities based on user votes. That is to say, for example, there are movies that show a similar liking structure with a movie that the person watches by being removed from being an object of the method. Similar movies can be found by finding similar reactions that other viewers collectively give to different movies. The movies with the highest correlation are selected and presented to the user as a recommendation.

# Aim
  Make suggestions based on product similarities
